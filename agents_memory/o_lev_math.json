Even if you're not specifically studying for your O-Levels right now, maybe we can tackle some interesting problems or explore a cool concept in mathematics that you might find intriguing.\n\nDo you have any particular area of math you generally enjoy (or, conversely, one you actively avoid)? Or should I just throw out a fun little challenge and see what happens? Let me know!\n"

Does that make sense?\n"
